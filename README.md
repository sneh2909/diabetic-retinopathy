## About

This project aims to  use Diabetic retinopathy detection using features from deep learning and fitting into machine learning algorithms and the data is taken form the kaggle  


Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is human eye disease among people with diabetics which causes damage to retina of eye and may eventually lead to complete blindness. Detection of diabetic retinopathy in early stage is essential to avoid complete blindness. Effective treatments for DR are  available though it requires early diagnosis and the continuous monitoring of diabetic patients. It is caused by the mutilations of the blood vessels of the light sensitive tissues at the back of the human retina. It is the most recurrent form of blindness in the working age group of people and is highly likely when diabetes is poorly controlled. Although method for detection of Diabetic retinopathy exist, they involve manual examination of the retinal image by an ophthalmologist. Also many physical tests like visual acuity test, pupil dilation, and optical coherence tomography can be used to detect diabetic retinopathy but are time consuming. The objective of this project  is to give decision about the presence of diabetic retinopathy by applying different machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms also using algorithms on images to extract features from different retinal image. It will give us  accuracy of which algorithm will be suitable and more accurate for prediction of the disease. Decision making for predicting the presence of diabetic retinopathy is performed using K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest , Support Vector Machine(SVM) , Decision Tree and deep learning algorithms like convolution neural network(CNN). The proposal approach of diabetic retinopathy detection aims to detect the complication using machine learning and deep learning.
